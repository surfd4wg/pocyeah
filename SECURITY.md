# Security Policy

We take the security of PocYeah seriously and appreciate your help in
keeping it safe.

## Running demos safely

A `demo.toml` executes arbitrary commands on your host by design — only run
specs you wrote or have read, and isolate anything untrusted as you see fit. You
are responsible for what you choose to run. See
[Running demos safely](README.md#running-demos-safely) in the README.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead,
report them privately in one of two ways:

- **Email** — send the details to
  [research@pillar.security](mailto:research@pillar.security).
- **GitHub Security Advisory** — open a private report via the
  [Security Advisories](https://github.com/pillar-labs/pocumentary/security/advisories/new)
  page for this repository.

Please include as much detail as you can:

- a description of the issue and its impact,
- the affected version or commit,
- steps to reproduce (a minimal `demo.toml` or command is ideal), and
- any suggested remediation.

We will acknowledge your report, keep you updated on our progress, and
coordinate a disclosure timeline with you once a fix is available.
