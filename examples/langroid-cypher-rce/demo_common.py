"""Shared rig for the langroid Neo4jChatAgent Cypher-injection demo (CVE-2026-55615).

Three OS processes, one per terminal, coordinate through small files in
DEMO_RUNTIME_DIR (injected by PocYeah) and one real TCP hop:

  - neo4j_role.py    : the Neo4j+APOC backend (the sink). Runs whatever Cypher
                       the agent sends. Models an instance with APOC / dbms.security
                       procedures enabled, so a `CALL apoc.os.exec([...])` reaches
                       the OS. That is the precondition the advisory names.
  - agent_role.py    : a langroid `Neo4jChatAgent` stand-in. Turns an incoming
                       chat prompt into a Cypher tool call and hands it to the
                       driver with NO validation — the actual vulnerability.
  - attacker_role.py : an untrusted prompt (direct or RAG-poisoned) that smuggles
                       the malicious Cypher into the agent.

Self-contained: Python stdlib only, no network egress, no API key, no real
Neo4j/LLM. The agent->database hop is a real localhost socket (the "driver
session"); the attacker->agent prompt is a file drop. The RCE at the end is
real: the backend launches Calculator via the OS. Authorized security research;
educational reproduction of a published, patched CVE only.
