# Contributing to PocYeah

Thanks for your interest in PocYeah! This project is maintained with a
deliberately narrow scope, and we want to be upfront about what kinds of
contributions we can accept so you don't spend effort on something we'll have
to turn away.

## What we welcome

- **Feature requests** — open an [issue](https://github.com/pillar-labs/pocumentary/issues)
  describing what you'd like PocYeah to do and why. We read every one, even
  if we can't act on all of them.
- **Bug fixes** — if you've found a bug, a pull request that fixes it is very
  welcome. Please include (or reference) a reproduction, and add a test that
  fails without your change and passes with it.

## What is out of scope

Anything beyond a feature request (as an issue) or a bug fix (as a PR) will not
be accepted. In particular, we generally will not merge:

- new features or large behavioral changes contributed as PRs (open an issue
  first so we can discuss whether it fits the project),
- refactors, restyling, or dependency churn that don't fix a specific bug, or
- changes that broaden PocYeah's scope beyond spec-driven demo recording.

If you're unsure whether something fits, open an issue and ask before writing
code — we'd rather save you the work.

## Working on a bug fix

```bash
uv sync                # install dependencies (including the dev group)
uv run pytest          # run the test suite
```

Please keep pull requests focused on a single bug, match the surrounding code
style, and make sure the full test suite passes before you open the PR.
