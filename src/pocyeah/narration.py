"""Pure TTS-narration substrate (N14/A7.4). No I/O, no engine, no screen.

The V7 sibling of subtitles.py: it turns the event-anchored [[annotation]]
sections plus a captured timeline into ordered narration Sections (each with the
time until the next event), the ffmpeg argv that mixes the synthesized clips onto
the recording, and the length checks. The effects — running the TTS engine and
ffmpeg — live in synth.py and postprod.py.

Path math uses os.path (not pathlib.Path) so the module stays clear of the pure
grep set's pathlib marker — the same choice gates.py and subtitles.py make.
