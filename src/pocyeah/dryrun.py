"""Headless demo execution (N13 local, A2.2) — the cheap iteration loop, R5.

Runs the same panes as `record` but as plain subprocesses: no Terminal, no
AppleScript, no ffmpeg, no pacing. That makes it fast, non-disruptive, and
runnable anywhere — including CI, which is the point. Do NOT add a macOS guard
to this module.

Each pane's combined stdout+stderr is redirected to a per-pane file in the
runtime directory rather than to a pipe. A pipe blocks the writer once ~64KB
goes unread, so a chatty pane that must also emit a gate signal would hang
before signalling — starving the gate and forcing a false timeout. A file
never blocks the writer, so the pane always makes progress; the consumer reads
the captured output back at its leisure.

Environment is *added to* the ambient one rather than replacing it, because
role scripts need PATH, HOME, and a working Python.
