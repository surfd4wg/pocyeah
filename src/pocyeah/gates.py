"""Pure gating decisions (the pure half of N10, A5).

Panes are launched in spec order, one at a time. A pane with `gate_on = "sig"`
is not launched until the previous panes have produced the file named `sig` in
the runtime directory — the file-handshake pattern from
docs/reference/fastmcp-cand003/demo_common.py (`server_ready`, `lure.txt`,
`takeover.json`) and its aws-mcp predecessor.

Both `record` (via the PTY recorder) and `dryrun` (via plain subprocesses)
consume the steps this module produces, so the two paths cannot drift on *what*
to wait for even though they differ on *how* to wait.
