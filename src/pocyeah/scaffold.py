The starter is a two-pane gated handshake mirroring examples/gated-demo.toml:
a server that signals readiness and a client that gates on it and writes the
file the [verify] block asserts. It validates and passes `dryrun` as emitted,
so a coding agent can scaffold, confirm the loop is green, then edit the roles
for its own demo. The CLI (an edge) writes these strings to disk.
