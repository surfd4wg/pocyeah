"""Pure image/GIF-overlay substrate (V8). No I/O, no screen, no network.

The "easter egg" sibling of subtitles.py: it turns event-anchored [[overlay]]
blocks plus a captured timeline into placements (when each GIF pops on, for how
long, how big, where) and the ffmpeg filtergraph/argv that burns them onto a
take. The effects — downloading a URL and running ffmpeg — live in cli.py and
postprod.py.

A GIF loops for its whole on-screen window via ffmpeg's `-ignore_loop 0` on the
image input; `overlay=...:enable='between(t,start,end)'` shows it only within
the window. Each GIF is sized to a fraction of the frame width with `scale2ref`
(aspect preserved) so it looks the same regardless of the recording's resolution.

Path math uses os.path (not pathlib.Path) so the module stays clear of the pure
grep set's pathlib marker — the same choice subtitles.py and gates.py make.
